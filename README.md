#Boston Housing Prices

This is the 3rd project for the Udacity Data Analyst - Nanodegree. 
Task was to choose any area of the world from https://www.openstreetmap.org and use data munging techniques, such as assessing the quality of the data for validity, accuracy, completeness, consistency and uniformity, to clean the OpenStreetMap data.My region is San Francisco,California.
Python was used to clean the data and prepare it for inserting into the SQL Database. Many queries were then run to arrive at interesting findings.
